# project-rock-paper-scissors
The Odin Project - practice project

Hi, any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

The JS for this project was hard to figure out at first but I learned so much by working on this project.

See the project at:
https://github.com/tmaldonado98/project-rock-paper-scissors

Again, please feel free to provide feedback! There's so much I'd like to learn from more advanced developers :)
